# smoke3785 boilerplate

Boilerplate code I use frequently in development

## simpleExpressServer

This is a simple boilerplate for an express server with routing, auth/error middleware, and controllers. It is easily extensible with JWT authentication through google. It uses old module imports (i.e. not ES6) but may be changed in the future.

## reactFirebaseAuthRouter

This boilerplate is for either static content in React or Dynamic content served via Firebase. It has a Context API, as well as all needed components for contextual authentication via Firebase. It also includes basic styles and components (along with functional modules) for routing, navigation, and simple page layouts.
